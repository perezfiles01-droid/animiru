// Diagnostic extension. Not a content source.
//
// Purpose: every failing extension on this repo is HLS, and the one that works
// (AnimeHeaven) is progressive MP4. That correlation has two mutually exclusive
// explanations which cannot be told apart from the provider side:
//
//   (a) Mangayomi's Windows player cannot handle HLS, or
//   (b) each HLS provider independently serves broken playlists.
//
// This extension removes the providers from the equation entirely. It makes no
// network requests to browse or resolve — the browse list, detail page and
// episode list are hardcoded, and getVideoList returns reference streams that
// are known-good and vendor-maintained (Apple's HLS conformance streams,
// Blender's Big Buck Bunny MP4). If these play, HLS on Windows is fine and the
// providers are rotten. If the MP4 plays and the HLS entries do not, the player
// is at fault and no extension change can fix it.
//
// Each episode isolates one variable; see EPISODES below.
class DefaultExtension extends MProvider {
  // Ordered so the diagnosis narrows as you go down the list. Every entry is a
  // separate episode so each can be launched and judged independently.

        //
        // 2026-08-10: the original Blender URL began returning 404, so this
        // control silently "failed" for reasons that had nothing to do with the
        // player — a dead control is worse than no control, because it reads as
        // a total playback failure. Two independent hosts now, so one going
        // away is visible as a disagreement rather than a false diagnosis.
        // Re-check both with a plain HTTP request before trusting a failure.
